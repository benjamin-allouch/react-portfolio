      description: [ "My name is Benjamin, 33, currently living between Paris and Podgorica (Montenegro). ","I've studied law, in France and, as en Erasmus student, in Sweden. I've graduated in 2013 with a Master in Data Protection and Intellectual Property Law. ","I've worked for 5 years, mostly about IT and Data Protection Law. These areas of law are getting more and more important today and probably the most important tomorrow. ","For professionnal and personal reasons, I want a career change. New technologies, digital transition and computer in general have always been an interest for me and that's why I chose to learn web development. ","As I am interested about blockchain technology too, I'd rather to work in this area, preferably as a freelance. My ultimate objective would be trying to mix my current legal skills with my future programming skills in a way I don't know yet. ","As I'm interested in many subjects, I could also be a freelance web editor with some programming skills. ","If you are familiar with French language, you can take a look at my two blogs. ","For the meantime, my programming skills include front-end development: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, some JavaScript and React. ","In case you're interested, my legal skills include GDPR and Data Protection Law (strong skills), IT and Contract Law. ","Feel free to contact me for more information, work project or future collaboration! ","Benjamin"],
